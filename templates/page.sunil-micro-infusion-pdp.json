Skin may experience mild swelling, peeling or flaking. You can minimize these effects by keeping the skin moisturized, which will reduce shedding and alleviate tightness.<\/li><li>Skip makeup for as long as you can, but at minimum, at least 24 hours.<\/li><li>No exercising or strenuous activity for the first 24 hours post-treatment. Sweating and gym environments are harmful, rife with bacteria, and may cause adverse reactions.<\/li><li>Keep in mind, anything you put on your skin after using Qure Microinfusion will absorb more easily, so it’s important to keep the skin clean and use products that don’t have harsh ingredients (no acids!).<\/li><li>Avoid touching your face, especially with dirty hands that haven’t been sanitized.<\/li><li>Avoid swimming, saunas and steam rooms for at least 24 hours post-treatment.<\/li><li>Avoid applying skincare products containing fragrances, active ingredients or acids such as Alpha Hydroxy Acids, Beta Hydroxy Acid, Retinol (Vitamin A), Vitamin C or anything perceived as ‘active’ skincare including scrubs or toners for at least 2-3 days post-treatment, as it may cause irritation.<\/li><li>Avoid exfoliating products for 2-3 days after treatment because they can be abrasive on skin when it is in that kind of condition.<\/li><li>Avoid direct sun exposure immediately after treatment. Apply a high protection sunscreen when going outdoors, and avoid prolonged sun exposure. Use good quality non-comedogenic sunscreen if going in the sun.<\/li><\/ul><p>By the next day, you should be free to resume your normal activities, skincare routine, and any makeup you want to apply—but you may not even need it.
